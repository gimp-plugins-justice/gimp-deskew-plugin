Deskew is a simple plugin to fix skewed scanned documents.

Usage
=====

Click Layer => Transform => Deskew.

The plugin has no options. GIMP will simply auto-straighten ("deskew") the image.

Installation
============

Building/installation procedure depends on where you got the source code from.

If you got source code from Git repository,

	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install

If you got a tarball with a version,

	./configure
	make
	make install

For both ./autogen.sh and ./configure you can use --prefix=INSTALL_PATH, where 
a typical installation path is /usr. By default /usr/local is used.
